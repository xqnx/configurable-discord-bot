# configurable-discord-bot

Very hastily made from a bot I created for my youth organization.
I don't recommend using this exactly but using features from it and entering your own channel/role ids, server name, and other customizable entries I left in comments and brackets.
This should make your discord.js experience a lot smoother and I left some example functions that you can use to create your own.

I used repl.it and UptimeBot (https://uptimerobot.com/) to host my bot for free and commented out most of those lines.
