# configurable-discord-bot

You can use features from this and enter your own channel/role ids, server name, and other customizable entries I left in comments and brackets.
This should make your discord.js experience a lot smoother and I left some example functions that you can use to create your own.

I used repl.it and UptimeBot (https://uptimerobot.com/) to host my bot for free and commented out most of those lines.
